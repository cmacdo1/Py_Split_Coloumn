This Python script is designed to read a CSV file, process its contents, and write the processed data to a new CSV file. Here's a breakdown of what each part of the script does:

1. The split_name function takes a full name as input, splits it into first name and last name, and returns them. If the full name is empty, it returns empty strings for the first name and last name.

2. The user is prompted to enter the location of the input file. The script then determines the directory, filename, and extension of the input file.

3. The output file is created in the same directory as the input file, with the same name and extension, but with "_Formated" appended to the name.

4. The script opens the input file for reading and the output file for writing. It uses the csv.DictReader class to read the input file, which treats each row as a dictionary where the keys are the field names and the values are the field values.

5. The field names for the output file are determined. They include "First Name" and "Last Name", as well as all the field names from the input file that are not "fullName", "id", "tier", "First Name", or "Last Name", and "Street", "City", "State", and "Zip".

6. The script uses the csv.DictWriter class to write to the output file. The field names determined in the previous step are used as the header row of the output file.

7. The script then processes each row in the input file. If a row is empty (i.e., all its fields are empty), it is skipped. The processing logic for non-empty rows is not shown in the provided code.
