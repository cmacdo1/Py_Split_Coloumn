This script reads data from a CSV file, splits the full names into first names and last names, and writes the data back to a new CSV file with the names separated.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. The split_name(full_name) function takes a full name as input, splits it into words, and assigns the first word to first_name and the rest to last_name. If the full name is empty, both first_name and last_name are set to empty strings.

2. The main() function first defines the names of the input and output files.

3. It then opens the input file for reading and the output file for writing. The with statement ensures that both files are properly closed after they are no longer needed.

4. A csv.DictReader object is created for the input file, and a csv.DictWriter object is created for the output file. The field names for the writer are the same as for the reader, with the addition of 'First Name' and 'Last Name'.

5. The header row is written to the output file.

6. The script then enters a loop where it processes each row from the input file. For each row, it retrieves the full name, splits it into first and last names using the split_name() function, adds these names to the row, and writes the row to the output file.

7. Finally, a message is printed to the console indicating that the operation was successful and where the output file was saved.
